**Abstract**

Material science is an interdisciplinary field that generally discovers new materials through
trial and error in the lab. Discovering new materials usually takes several years of research,
as well as a considerable amount of resources and investments. Currently, one of the
most relevant materials are perovskites, as they hold great promise for the development
of solar cells. The crystallization mechanism is the most relevant method to synthesize
perovskites as it allows a detailed (compositional and chemical) characterization of the
material structure, among the different methods.
However, because of the sensitivity of the crystallization process, experimental con-
ditions that produce pervoskite crystals are hardly discovered. Hence,the experimental
trial and error process usually results in imbalanced data (where most experiments do not
produce crystals).

In this context, studies have shown that it is possible to develop classification models
that predict perovskite crystallization using data collected in laboratory experiments. Ho-
wever, from a methodological point of view, these models have been developed without
considering the characteristics of using experimental data (such as the limited data avai-
lable, class imbalances, biases in data collection, among others).
In this work, we studied model evaluation sensitivity to errors in data collection and
experimental data sampling. Therefore, we analyzed how traditional classification metrics
behave, using synthetic confusion matrices, when small and imbalance datasets are used.
We proposed an alternative evaluation method, based on a bidimensional representation
of two complementary metrics, which makes it easier to distinguish model performance.
Finally, we applied this method to study ensamble models for small datasets, concluding
that the combination of specialized models in different classes produces high-performance
models. _This thesis suggest chemistry community in ML focusing more on model reliability 
than improving performance of traditional metrics in future research. _
